## Description

Extra**Quest**Button adds a button that will show the quest item for the closest quest with an item, it is basically the Extra**Action**Button of quests!

By default it will share the key binding with the Extra**Action**Button, which can be disabled by binding a key to the Extra**Quest**Button.

If they share the key binding and both are to be shown, Extra**Action**Button will be shown instead of the Extra**Quest**Button.

Use the Edit Mode to change settings.
