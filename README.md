# ExtraQuestButton

This is an addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft".  
It can be downloaded at [Curse](http://curse.com/addons/wow/extraquestbutton) or at [WoWInterface](http://wowinterface.com/downloads/info23464).

## Description

ExtraQuestButton adds a button to the game that will display a button for the most representable quest item for your quests.  
It is basically replicating the Extra*Action*Button, just for quest items!

Now, by "most representable" I mean that it will show the quest item for the quest area that you are closest to, and never unless you are in some range of where it should be used (hardcoded to 250 yards).

It uses the same keybinding as the Extra*Action*Button, and it's even anchored to it, so when you move the Extra*Action*Button, Extra*Quest*Button follows suit!  
This means that if you want to move it you can just use any addon that moves the Extra*Action*Button around.

This was designed to replicate the same effect as the quest items in Tanaan Jungle worked, just for everything else.

If both the Extra*Action*Button and the Extra*Quest*Button are to be shown, the Extra*Action*Button takes precedence, and the transition looks something like this:
