# ExtraQuestButton

This is an addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft".  
It can be downloaded at [Curse](//curseforge.com/wow/addons/extraquestbutton), [WoWInterface](//wowinterface.com/downloads/info23464), or from the releases here on GitHub.

## Description

Extra**Quest**Button adds a button that will show the quest item for the closest quest with an item, it is basically the Extra**Action**Button of quests!

By default it will share the key binding with the Extra**Action**Button, which can be disabled by binding a key to the Extra**Quest**Button.

If they share the key binding and both are to be shown, Extra**Action**Button will be shown instead of the Extra**Quest**Button.

Type `/eqb` in the chat to see the options.
